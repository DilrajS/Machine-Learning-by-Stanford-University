## Assignments

Detailed solutions and code for various machine learning assignments throughout the course. Each assignment explores different algorithms and methodologies in machine learning.

## Notes

The Stanford Machine Learning Course, taught by Professor Andrew Ng, offers an extensive introduction into the world of machine learning, data mining, and statistical pattern recognition. Here's a summary of the key concepts I learned:

### 1. **Comprehensive Introduction** 
   - **Machine Learning (ML)**: The science of making computers act without explicit programming. 
   - **Data Mining**: Discovering patterns in large datasets.
   - **Statistical Pattern Recognition**: Recognition of patterns and regularities in data.

### 2. **Supervised Learning Techniques**
   - Algorithms and methodologies that rely on labeled data to predict outcomes. This includes:
     - **Parametric/Non-parametric Algorithms**
     - **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
     - **Kernels**
     - **Neural Networks**

### 3. **Unsupervised Learning Topics**
   - Learning algorithms that do not rely on labeled data, focusing on intrinsic structures in the data. Topics covered:
     - **Clustering**
     - **Dimensionality Reduction**
     - **Recommender Systems**
     - **Deep Learning**

### 4. **Machine Learning Best Practices**
   - **Bias/Variance Theory**: Understanding the trade-offs and finding the right balance to improve model accuracy.
   - **Innovation Process in AI**: Best practices from Silicon Valley on ML and AI solution development.

### 5. **Practical Applications and Case Studies**
   - Implementations of machine learning algorithms in real-world scenarios like:
     - **Smart Robotics**: Enhancing robot perception and control.
     - **Text Understanding**: Web search, anti-spam.
     - **Computer Vision**: Recognizing and interpreting visual data.
     - **Medical Informatics**: Interpreting medical data and predictive modeling.
     - **Database Mining**: Extracting patterns from large datasets.
